### PartA - Conflict Management - Overwriting Remote Changes
Under the `Checkpoin3` i have created a subfolder `conflict-resolution` 
and added files into it. then i have `push` the changes. What color will the text appear? from `red` to `green`

### PartB - Conflict Management - Resetting Local Commit Head
What color will the text be after forcefully overwriting remote changes with local changes? After modifying on `GitHub` the color for `red` to `marron`, 
then i created conflict by updating the color in (local repo) to `darkolivegreen`

### PartC - Conflict Management - Merge Editor
Managing the conflict using the `VSCode` I have `Accept Incoming` and `Accept Current` for the second part. After accepting both changes, the process moves towards the `Complete Merge`
